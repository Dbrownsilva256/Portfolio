		<h1>My Geography 485L/585L Home Page</h1>
		<p>About me: I am a senior in the Environemental Science Department working on a minor in GIS. I am a native to San Luis Obispo, California and wish to return to the region after I complete my undergraduate studies here at the University of New Mexico.</p>
		<p>I'm taking the course because I would like to see other options to manipulate spatial data rather than using ArcGIS. I also have never worked with code before and feel like it would be beneficial.</p>
